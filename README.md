From 2014. Just a little Single Page Application that my wedding guests can login to and RSVP. It keeps a database of responses on Azure.

I keep this here for posterity. At this point in my life, I had been a Java developer for 14 years. I was looking to make the switch into .NET, and wanted to practice what I'd learned. Shortly after this I accepted a job in a .NET shop, so this tinkering paid off.
